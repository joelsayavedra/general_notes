## General description
This project is intended to be a practice about basic programming concepts. 
Changes will be added as I learn new things.

---
## Rules
This project has a simple set of **rules**.
1. Language is english, for the sake of underestandability.
2. Code does not seek for utility, is written with the only purpose of __learning.__ So, code won't be performant, nor compact.
3. Is heavily encouraged to make *silly examples* and to [*add cats*](https://i.natgeofe.com/n/548467d8-c5f1-4551-9f58-6817a8d2c45e/NationalGeographic_2572187_3x2.jpg) wherever is possible.
